# Cov-MS-scoring

This repository contains the code and results for an initial exploration of machine learning-based scoring of mass spectrometry-based SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing. Feedback and suggestions are welcome in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/compomics/Cov-MS-scoring/issues).

All information, code, and results are available in a Jupyter Notebook, which can be
easily opened statically with Jupyter, or interactively with Binder:
